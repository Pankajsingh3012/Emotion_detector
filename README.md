An emotion detector using CNN is a project that aims to build a system that can recognize and classify human emotions from facial images. A CNN, or convolutional neural network, is a type of deep learning model that can process images and extract features that are relevant for the task. An emotion detector using CNN typically involves the following steps:

Data collection: A dataset of facial images with labeled emotions is collected. The dataset should have a balanced distribution of different emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, etc. One example of such a dataset is the FER-2013 dataset1, which has 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces with seven emotions.
Data preparation: The images are preprocessed and normalized to make them suitable for the CNN model. The labels are also converted to categorical or one-hot encoded format. The data is then split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model building: A CNN model is designed and implemented using a framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model consists of several layers, such as convolutional, pooling, activation, flatten, and fully connected layers. The model architecture can be customized or based on existing models, such as LeNet, ResNet, or EfficientNet2345.
Model training: The CNN model is trained on the training set using an optimizer, a loss function, and a metric. The model parameters are updated based on the gradient descent algorithm. The model performance is monitored on the validation set to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The model can also use techniques such as image augmentation, dropout, or batch normalization to improve its generalization ability.
Model evaluation: The CNN model is evaluated on the test set using the chosen metric, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. The model can also be tested on new or unseen images to check its robustness and reliability. The model can also be visualized or interpreted to understand how it makes predictions and what features it learns.
Model deployment: The CNN model is deployed as an application that can take an image input from the user and output the predicted emotion. The application can use a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web interface to interact with the user. The application can also use a webcam or a camera to capture live images of the user and display the emotion in real-time.
